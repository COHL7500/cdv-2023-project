As temperatures rise, northern hardwoods will lose their advantage. We can expect to see increasingly fewer bird species associated with northern forests."
Birds,snowy_plover,0,42,56,70,86,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,700,100,150,3,Coastal-nesting birds such as snowy plover are among the most threatened by climate change. Rising sea levels will reduce nesting areas available for coastal and salt marsh nesting birds. Birds that depend on those shellfish and fish communities for food will also be affected.
Birds,arctic_tern,0,13,18.75,25,31,37,43,49,55,61,67,73,79,600,250,150,6,"The site of living for arctic tern is literally iceland, the arctic. According to rising of temperature, the arctic tern's dependence on the ice throughout their non-breeding period in Antarctica highlights the vulnerability of the species to climate change."
Birds,adélie_penguin,0,5,7.5,10,12.5,15,17.5,20,23.5,27,30.5,34,37.5,1300,750,100,6,It is only in recent decades that we know Adélie penguins population declines are associated with warming. The researchers reported that climate change impacts on penguins in the Antarctic will likely be highly site-specific based on regional climate trends.
Birds,ivory_gull,0,10.5,14,17.5,24,27.5,31,34.5,38,41.5,45,48.5,52,200,200,150,6,The Ivory Gull’s existence is inextricably linked to the Arctic ice. The species lives its life at the top of a complex ice-associated food web and has evolved to fill a niche in one of the harshest environments on earth. Climate change that impacting melting ice is certainly the greatest long-term threat to the Ivory Gull.

The reason may be that migratory species are unable to adjust their migration schedules to coincide with the shifting peak abundance of their far away food sources.
Insects,bumblebee,0,45,60,75,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,1525,925,110,2.5,"Due to the impact of climate change, the majority of bumblebee species have failed to disperse beyond their northern range limits, while suffering losses at their southern range limits. If the population of bumblebee decrease, sufficient pollination may also become hard following natural consequence."
Insects,butterfly,0,48,64,88,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,175,1000,175,2.5,"According to association report, around two-thirds of butterfly species have declined in the UK over the past 40 years. If this trend continues, it might have unpredictable knock-on effects for other species in the ecosystem. Only by arming ourselves with an understanding of why butterfly numbers are down can we hope to halt or reverse the decline."

Despite being resilient animals, rising ocean temperatures, ocean acidification, and rising sea levels are just some aspects of climate change that will impact marine mammals, their food sources, and their homes."

Furthermore, one of the world’s largest tiger populations could disappear by the end of this century as rising sea levels caused by climate change destroy their habitat."
