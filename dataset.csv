As temperatures rise, northern hardwoods will lose their advantage. We can expect to see increasingly fewer bird species associated with northern forests."
Birds,snowy_plover,0,42,56,70,86,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,700,100,3,Coastal-nesting birds such as snowy plover are among the most threatened by climate change. Rising sea levels will reduce nesting areas available for coastal and salt marsh nesting birds. Birds that depend on those shellfish and fish communities for food will also be affected.
Birds,arctic_tern,0,13,18.75,25,31,37,43,49,55,61,67,73,79,600,250,6,"The site of living for arctic tern is literally iceland, the arctic. According to rising of temperature, the arctic tern's dependence on the ice throughout their non-breeding period in Antarctica highlights the vulnerability of the species to climate change. "

The researchers reported that climate change impacts on penguins in the Antarctic will likely be highly site-specific based on regional climate trends.
Insects,bumblebee,0,45,60,75,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,1525,900,2.5,"Due to the impact of climate change, the majority of bumblebee species have failed to disperse beyond their northern range limits, while suffering losses at their southern range limits. If the population of bumblebee decrease, sufficient pollination may also become hard following natural consequence."
Insects,butterfly,0,48,64,88,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,200,1000,2.5,"According to association report, around two-thirds of butterfly species have declined in the UK over the past 40 years. If this trend continues, it might have unpredictable knock-on effects for other species in the ecosystem. Only by arming ourselves with an understanding of why butterfly numbers are down can we hope to halt or reverse the decline."

Despite being resilient animals, rising ocean temperatures, ocean acidification, and rising sea levels are just some aspects of climate change that will impact marine mammals, their food sources, and their homes."
Mammals,tiger,0,12.5,18.75,25,31.25,42.5,51.25,60,68.75,77.5,86.25,95,100,300,800,6,"Tigers are among the world’s most threatened species regarding climate change impact. Furthermore, one of the world’s largest tiger populations could disappear by the end of this century as rising sea levels caused by climate change destroy their habitat."

Mammals,polar_bear,0,13,19,25,31,37,43,49,55,61,67,73,79,1100,750,6,"Polar bears are the poster child for the impacts of climate change on species. Since their importantly site of living is sea ice. It is important to increase monitoring of polar bear populations, particularly their responses to declining sea ice."
Marine Life,cod,0,4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36,40,44,48,400,700,5,"The size of marine populations has declined by almost between 1970 and 2012 according to WWF’s Living Blue Planet Report 2015. Seafood is our last major food source that is truly wild.The stakes are high when we consider how intrinsically linked the health of our oceans is to our environmental, social and economic wellbeing."
Marine Life,shark,0,22.5,30,37.5,45,66,70,77.5,85,92.5,100,100,100,900,650,6,"The increase in temperature over the last few years has negatively affected the habitat of sharks and endangers their lives. In conclusion, global warming has made it difficult for sharks to continue surviving since the sea level and temperature of the water are tend to keep rising."
